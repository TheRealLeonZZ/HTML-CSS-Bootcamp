Some key notes:
Stored as much variables as I needed to make code clean and easy to manage.
Created basic elements and classes for fast and easy build. (headings in all sizes, links)
Created layout styles like section-container, two-column + col_left + col_right, col, cards, subtitles, secondary text and buttons.
Rotated backgrounds.
Animated gradient.

For different screen sizes, tackle small parts first.
Adjust screen size to tablet and phone, but if needed add more breakpoints inbetween.
