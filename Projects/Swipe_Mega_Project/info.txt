Some key notes:
Stored as much variables as I needed to make code clean and easy to manage.
Created basic elements and classes for fast and easy build. (headings in all sizes, links)
Created layout styles like section-container, two-column + col_left + col_right, cards, subtitles, secondary text and buttons.
